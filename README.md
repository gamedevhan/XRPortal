AR/Unity Developer Test Project

This is a source code of Android application that I built.
ARCore 1.4.0, Unity 2018.2.3. were used to develop this project.

To build:
1. Android JDK and SDK must be installed.
2. Change Unity settings according to: https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-android
3. Switch build platform to Android in player settings.
